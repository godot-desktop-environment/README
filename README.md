# README

The idea is creating tools using Godot until we obtain the bare minimum for a
Desktop Environment. No reason, just for fun.

## Topics

Each repository should have one the following topics:

- GUI
  - A complete graphical user interface for one task
- Component
  - A utility node/scene for creating GUIs
